# Final-test-for-the-main-block
This repository was created as part of the “Final test for the main block”.

This work is necessary to test my knowledge and skills following the completion of the first block of training in the Developer program. Our mentors must make sure that the basic introduction to IT is successful.

The following problem was solved: write a program that, from an existing array of strings, forms a new array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters. The initial array can be entered from the keyboard, or specified at the start of the algorithm. When deciding, it was not recommended to use collections; it was proposed to use arrays exclusively.

Examples:
[“Hello”, “2”, “world”, “:-)”] → [“2”, “:-)”]
[“1234”, “1567”, “-2”, “computer science”] → [“-2”]
[“Russia”, “Denmark”, “Kazan”] → []
